## 📜 What is Advent of Code?  

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual coding event that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day unlocks a new puzzle, combining programming skills with creative problem-solving. Think of it as a holiday-themed treasure hunt for developers! 🧩
